  <h2>A Place I Would Like To Visit</h2>
  
  <!--Mention lifestyle and variety of culture in France-->
  
  <p class="place-description">If I could visit any place in the world, I would visit the country, France. I would 
  visit France because I love the culture, different cuisine, and the variety of 
  architecture. I also want to experience the different lifestyles in each city there.</p>

  <h2>A Person I Admire <br> (past or present)</h2>
  
  <p class="person-description">One person that I admire dearly is Audrey Hepburn. She is more of a role model to me.
  If you don't know who she is, she was an actress and starred in many classic movies. For
  example, Breakfast at Tiffany's and Sabrina. I admire her acting and style. In Sabrina, 
  her character visits Paris and from that movie, I loved France even more. <span class="important-point">
  She was a humanitarian and I believe she won an award for that.</span> Sadly, she passed, but I still
  admire her so much.</p>
